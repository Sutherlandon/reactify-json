# Reactify JSON Project

This is an example project that implements the library `reactify-json` that allows you to build React components with JSON.

This use case that inspired this library was a dynamic form builder.  `reactify-json` allows you to store react components in a database like MongoDB as JSON, then pull it out and hydrate it into React components. This would allow someone to create an admin interface where forms can be created by users and stored in databases.  Form building without the code.

This being an example project, you can clone it and fire it up with `yarn start` to see it in action!
